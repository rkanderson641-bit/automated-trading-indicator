# Automated Trading Indicator

Simple technical indicators for trading research.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the reversal-confluence indicator against live intraday price data:

```bash
python3 main.py AAPL --period 5d --interval 5m --fast 10 --slow 30 --min-confluence 2
```

This fetches intraday OHLC bars for the ticker and generates BUY/SELL
signals from a fast/slow SMA crossover, then scores each signal against
three reversal confluences:

- **Swing structure breaks** — price closing beyond the most recent prior
  swing high/low, indicating a potential trend reversal rather than
  mid-trend noise
- **0.5-0.618 fibonacci pullback zone** — the classic institutional
  order-fill retracement zone measured from the most recent swing move
- **8:30-9:30am America/Chicago opening range breakout (ORB)** — whether
  price is trading outside the high/low range set in the first 30 minutes
  after the US cash open

Signals are reported with a `confluence_score` (how many of the above line
up) and the matching reasons. Use `--min-confluence` to filter out
low-confluence (likely noisier) signals.

### Library usage

```python
from sma import calculate_sma

prices = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
calculate_sma(prices, window=3)
# [11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0]
```
